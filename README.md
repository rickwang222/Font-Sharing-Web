## Screenshots of Site

**[Add a screenshot of each key page (around 4)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository)
along with a very brief caption:**

Profile page to view specific user uploaded fonts
![](/mock-ups/new_profile.png?raw=true "Profile Page")

Home page to view all fonts
![](/mock-ups/new_home.png?raw=true "Home Page")

Upload page to upload a font
![](/mock-ups/upload.png?raw=true "Upload Page")


## Mock-up 

There are a few tools for mock-ups. Paper prototypes (low-tech, but effective and cheap), Digital picture edition software (gimp / photoshop / etc.), or dedicated tools like moqups.com (I'm calling out moqups here in particular since it seems to strike the best balance between "easy-to-use" and "wants your money" -- the free teir isn't perfect, but it should be sufficient for our needs with a little "creative layout" to get around the page-limit)

In this space please either provide images (around 4) showing your prototypes, OR, a link to an online hosted mock-up tool like moqups.com

**[Add images/photos that show your paper prototype (around 4)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository) along with a very brief caption:**
